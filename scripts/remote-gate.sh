#
#   remote-gate.sh --pr 123 herdr            the herdr pack's gate (AGENTS.md), per Node version
#   remote-gate.sh --sha 1a2b3c4 plugin bots-dsh   a plugin's install, lint and node --test
#   remote-gate.sh --sha 1a2b3c4 bun          the repository's bun run check

#
# Only the named ref is fetched from REMOTE_GATE_REMOTE, into refs/remote-gate/ (a pull request's
# head, or one commit by its full sha when the clone lacks it); no other ref changes. It is
# checked out in a detached worktree, removed on any exit (git worktree remove --force, then
# prune). At most REMOTE_GATE_SLOTS gates run at once (mkdir slots); a gate waits for a free slot
# up to REMOTE_GATE_LOCK_TIMEOUT seconds, then gives up. Each step's full output goes to a log
# folder; the screen gets one line per step and the counts. A test step passes only with exit 0,
# a summary, at least one test, and no failed or cancelled test (as scripts/test-guard.mjs).
# At the start, refs/remote-gate/* not fetched or used for REMOTE_GATE_KEEP_DAYS (a stamp per ref)
# and log folders older than that go, and so does a worktree whose gate is surely gone.
#
# Needs Linux's GNU coreutils (mv -T, stat -c): a slot is claimed by renaming a folder that already
# holds its owner, so no slot is ever seen without one. A gate's identity is its pid, its start
# time in clock ticks (/proc/<pid>/stat) and the boot id: no time zone or clock step changes it.
# One REMOTE_GATE_BASE serves one pid namespace: gates in containers that share a base read each
# other's pids as gone and take each other's slots and worktrees, so give each namespace its own.
# The clone's git lock is never taken over from a gate of this boot, even a dead one (it says how
# to clear it); one whose owner names another boot id is from before a reboot and is cleared.
#
# Heads before the merged script kept their state in <clone>/.remote-gate, this one in
# <clone>-gate: the two share no slots and no git lock, so never run both against one clone.
#
# Environment (all optional):
#   REMOTE_GATE_ENV            a file sourced first (PATH, NVM_DIR, the variables below)
#   REMOTE_GATE_REPO           the clone (default: the checkout holding this script)
#   REMOTE_GATE_BASE           worktrees, locks and logs (default: <repo>-gate, beside the clone,
#                              so a worktree never resolves imports from the clone's node_modules)
#   REMOTE_GATE_REMOTE         remote to fetch from (default: origin)
#   REMOTE_GATE_SLOTS          gates at once (default: 3)
#   REMOTE_GATE_LOCK_TIMEOUT   seconds to wait for a slot (default: 1800)
#   REMOTE_GATE_GIT_TIMEOUT    seconds to wait for the clone's fetch lock (default: 600)
#   REMOTE_GATE_KEEP_DAYS      days to keep refs/remote-gate/* and logs (default: 7)
#   REMOTE_GATE_NODE_VERSIONS  herdr gate's Node versions, nvm-installed (default: "24 22 24.9.0")
#   REMOTE_GATE_PLUGIN_NODE    Node for the plugin, bun and desktop gates (default: 24.9, as CI)
#   REMOTE_GATE_NPM_CACHE      desktop gate's npm cache (default: <REMOTE_GATE_BASE>/npm-cache;
#                              a relative one is taken from the folder the gate is started in)
#   REMOTE_GATE_TEST_CONCURRENCY  herdr node --test concurrency (default: 8; Node's own default
#                              is one less than the cores, too many beside other work)
#   NVM_DIR                    where nvm keeps Node (default: $HOME/.nvm)
#   CHROME_BIN                 bots-dsh's browser (default: one at a usual path, if any)
#
# The desktop gate runs apps/desktop's main-process tests as CI's desktop job does: Node 24.9,
# npm ci --no-fund --no-audit with ELECTRON_SKIP_BINARY_DOWNLOAD=1 and DO_NOT_TRACK=1, then npm
# test (node --test). It unsets NODE_ENV (CI has none) and passes --include=dev, so neither the
# box's environment nor its npmrc (omit, npm_config_omit) makes npm ci drop the devDependencies.
# It is Electron-free: no Electron binary is downloaded or started, and no app is launched. That
# does not rest on ELECTRON_SKIP_BINARY_DOWNLOAD: the pinned electron (44.5.0) registers no
# install script, so npm ci never runs its download, and the flag stays only to match CI.
# Nothing runs Electron UI tests, here or on CI. What stays with CI: desktop-build.yml packages
# the app, and boot-check.yml boots the plugins' web UI in a headless browser.
# npm's download cache is reused by later gates; node_modules is installed fresh into each gate's
# throwaway worktree, never cached across shas. The cache under the gate base is removed whole
# once it is REMOTE_GATE_KEEP_DAYS old, by a gate that starts while no other holds a slot, and
# the next desktop gate starts cold. A cache set anywhere else is never swept.
#
# What differs from CI: the herdr gate leaves out test/am-quota-write.test.mjs, by the owner's
# rule that it never runs on our machines (CI still runs it). That rule is an instruction
# the owner gave the team; it is written down here and nowhere else in the repository (AGENTS.md
# and CI run every test file). Its static checks run once, on the first Node. A version like 24
# is the newest one nvm has installed, not the newest released; the record names the exact one. bun is
# whatever PATH has (CI pins 1.4.4); the record names it. The plugin gate does not fetch Omni for
# welcome-dsh. Without a browser it unsets CI, so bots-dsh's layout check skips instead of failing,
# and says so; with one it sets CHROME_BIN and CI as CI does. The desktop gate is CI's desktop job
# on Linux only (CI also runs windows-latest), reusing an npm cache where CI starts cold; its Node
# 24.9 and npm flags are CI's, with --include=dev added. Packaging and the boot check stay with CI.
#
# Signals: bash runs a trap only once the running command returns, so a TERM to this script
# waits for the step in progress (a test run can take minutes) before the cleanup; a terminal's
# ctrl-C reaches the whole process group and stops the step at once.
set -euo pipefail
# As on a Mac and on CI's runners. Under a 002 umask (one group per user, common on Linux) the
# tests' fixture files come out group-writable, and the worker refuses to read those.
