# RFCs

Proposals for changes that others rely on. How to write one: [RFC 0000](0000-rfc-process.md).

## In short

- **Write one** for a contract (update feed, pairing, wire protocol, signing key, app ID), privacy
  or permissions, a new component, or reversing a decision. Not for fixes, refactors or docs.
- **Start** from [`_Templates/rfc.md`](../_Templates/rfc.md), take the next number, add a row
  below, open a pull request into `dev`.
- **Status:** Draft → Accepted (dated owner line) → Implemented (merged), or Superseded /
  Withdrawn.

Monorepo RFCs that change Pocket's contract, privacy or permissions (they live in the monorepo's
[docs/rfcs](../../../../docs/rfcs/)):

| RFC | Title | Status | Pocket's part |
|---|---|---|---|
| [0015](../../../../docs/rfcs/0015-live-chat-projection.md) | Live chat projection: an agent terminal as a chat, Pocket Link's chat route | Accepted | Delivery 5: the Chat tab; transcripts reach the phone, in memory only ([privacy](../privacy.md)) |
| [0015, amendment](../../../../docs/rfcs/0015-live-chat-projection.md#amendments) | Writes on DSH chats: send, interrupt and approve from the phone | Draft (owner gate) | `dshWrite` in the chat `hello`; first answer wins, the other card closes with a receipt; the per-project yes still gates; privacy.md changes with the pocket PR |
