# Automagik Pocket privacy policy

Effective 2026-11-06. Applies to the Android app **Automagik Pocket** (app ID
`ai.namastex.automagik`), published from
[automagik-dev/automagik](https://github.com/automagik-dev/automagik/tree/dev/apps/pocket) (`apps/pocket/`;
before 2026-11, [automagik-dev/automagik-pocket](https://github.com/automagik-dev/automagik-pocket)).

## In short

- The app connects your phone to **your own computers**. We run no server for it and have no
  account system.
- **No analytics, no ads, no tracking.** The app contains no analytics or advertising library.
- The only other services it contacts: **GitHub**, to check for updates, and **n0's iroh
  services**: relays, which carry Pocket Link traffic they cannot read, and an address lookup,
  where the phone and the Pocket Link bridge on your computer each publish their public key and
  the n0 relay they currently use (no IP addresses).
- What it keeps stays on the phone, is not backed up, and is deleted when you uninstall.

## What the app handles, and where it goes

| Data | Where it goes | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Terminal screens, agent status, messages and replies you type or speak | Only between the phone and your machine | This is what the app is for |
| Chat: an agent's transcript (its messages, tool calls with their input and output, approvals, questions and token counts) and the Automagik Bots' chats, sent by Pocket Link's chat route ([RFC 0015](../../../docs/rfcs/0015-live-chat-projection.md)) | Only between the phone and your machine. Kept in memory while the chat is open, dropped when you leave it. While Home or Team shows, the list of the Bots' chats (each one's name, state, whether it is shown and, while it waits on a question or an approval, the request's text) is read every 30 seconds and kept in memory only, with what the phone saw of each chat's state between two readings and, for a request it saw answered, who answered and what (the Home row's Done line). Never written to the phone's storage, never logged, never sent anywhere else | To show an agent as a chat beside its terminal. Tool output can hold secrets such as tokens; it is the same text the terminal already shows the phone, and it is not redacted |
| What you type, approve, deny or stop in an Automagik Bot's chat, when that computer's Pocket Link says it takes the phone's writes ([RFC 0015](../../../docs/rfcs/0015-live-chat-projection.md), Amendments, 2026-11-07) | Sent over Pocket Link to that computer's Automagik (DSH), and nowhere else: a message becomes your prompt in the Bot's current chat, recorded in that chat as yours; an approval or a question's answer settles that one request; Stop cancels the running turn. The computer records your phone's name with an approval you answer. Nothing of it is kept on the phone or logged | So you can talk to your Bots and answer their approvals from the phone. Only for the Bots the computer shows: a project's after its yes in Herdr or Automagik, and the global Bots, the Main Bot included. Allow for the whole session stays on the computer. Remove the phone in Pocket Link to end its writes within 2 seconds |
| Paired machine details: name, session name, the desktop's Pocket Link ticket | Stays on the phone | To reconnect |
| Machines saved over SSH by an older version: name, hostname, SSH user, port, session name, host key fingerprint | Stays on the phone and is never used to connect; deleted when you pair that computer with QR or remove it | So the card can ask you to pair it again ([RFC 0008](rfcs/0008-drop-ssh.md)) |
| The phone's make and model (for example "Pixel 8") | Sent once to the desktop you pair with | So the desktop can name the paired phone. The desktop lists it beside a fingerprint of the phone's Pocket Link public key, which it already has, so two phones with the same name can be told apart |
| Folder git status, origin remote URL and Herdr desktop program icons | Read from your machine; the git answers stay in memory, icons cached on the phone | To draw the spaces tree like the desktop, and to group spaces into projects and branches into tasks |
| Usage meter summary: token counts and estimated $ per repository, branch, model and hour (the `herdr-meter` document, if you run the meter) | Read from your own machines and kept in memory; never written, never sent anywhere else | To show spend on Home and Code |
| Space Row stats in that document (merges with their PR/MR links, time to merge, first pass, $ and tokens per model, per bot) and bot and category names from each project's `.herdr/bots.json` | Read from your own machines and kept in memory; never written, never sent anywhere else | To show each space's stats line and its bots' cards, as the desktop sidebar does |
| Teams: each project's bots from its `.herdr/bots.json` (id, name, main or member, look), their live state, Herdr's space icons and colours (`shared.json` and its `space-icons/` images) and the bots' pets (`~/.automagik/bots/pets`) | Read from your own machines, never written there. A copy of the projects, bots and their last known state, the space images and the pets stays on the phone | So Teams opens at once, and offline, as you last saw it |
| Update check (app version in the request) | GitHub | To offer a newer release |

Nothing else is collected. We, the developers, receive none of this data.

## Network connections

1. **Your machines over Pocket Link.** iroh connections, end-to-end encrypted, dialled by public
   key. When no direct path exists, the encrypted traffic passes through relay servers run by n0
   (the iroh project). Relays forward the encrypted bytes; they can't read them, though they do
   see the network addresses involved. The phone and the Pocket Link bridge on your computer each
   publish their public key and the n0 relay they currently use to n0's address lookup, iroh's
   default, so the phone finds the computer after its IP address changes. No IP addresses are
   published, though n0's servers see the address each request comes from.
2. **GitHub.** When the app opens (at most every 15 minutes), every 6 hours while it or **Watch in
   background** runs, and when you tap **Settings → About → Check for updates**, the app downloads
   `latest.json` from this repo's latest GitHub release. When a newer version is out it downloads
   the APK from GitHub too: on its own on Wi-Fi with **Install updates automatically** on, otherwise
   when you tap **Install**. GitHub sees your IP address and a User-Agent with the app version. The
   check itself can't be turned off in the current version.
3. **Web links.** A link you tap in a terminal opens in your browser. In a chat, a link shows its
   address and opens only after you tap it and confirm; a chat loads no image or other web content
   by itself, and shows HTML as plain text.

## What is stored on the phone

- Your saved machines and settings.
- The phone's Pocket Link (iroh) key, in app storage that Android never backs up.
- Only if you used SSH in an older version: that version's SSH key, in the same storage. The app
  deletes it once no machine saved over SSH is left.
- Cached program icons, and a downloaded update until it installs.
- The Teams tab's copy, in an SQLite database: projects, bots and their last known state, and today's
  most agents working at once, which the phone counts itself; plus the space images and pets copied
  from your machines. Each reading of a machine replaces that machine's part.
- The last crash report, if the app crashed (below).

App backup and device-to-device transfer are turned off for all of it. Uninstalling the app deletes
it all, including the keys. There is no way to export the private keys.

## Crash reports

If the app crashes, it saves one report on the phone: app version, Android version, phone make
and model, the time, and the error's stack trace. It holds no keys and no saved settings; an error message in the
stack trace can still name things such as a machine.

Nothing is sent automatically. On the next launch the app says it closed unexpectedly; **Report**
opens **Settings → About**, where you can **Copy report**, **Share** it (Android's share sheet: you
choose the app and the recipient), or **Clear** it.

## Microphone

Used only when you tap the microphone in the side-button assistant panel. The app uses Android's
`SpeechRecognizer`, which hands the audio to the phone's **default speech recognition service**
(chosen in Android's settings, often Google's). That service turns it into text, and the app puts
the text in the message box for you to send. The app itself never records or stores audio. Whether
the audio leaves the phone depends on that service and its own privacy policy.

## Camera

Used only while you scan a Pocket Link QR code. The bundled scanner (ZXing) reads the code on the
phone. No picture is stored or sent.

## Notifications and the lock screen

- Notifications show what an agent asks or finished, so their text comes from your machines.
- **Answer from the lock screen** is off by default. While it's off, notifications are marked
  private, so Android hides their text on a secure lock screen, and replying or using the side-button panel asks you to unlock first. If you
  turn it on, anyone holding your locked phone can read and answer agents.

## Permissions

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| Internet | Connect to your machines, n0's Pocket Link relays and address lookup, and GitHub for updates |
| Notifications | Alert you when an agent needs you or finishes |
| Foreground service (special use) | **Watch in background**: keep connections open while you're away, with a "Watching" notification you can stop |
| Run at startup | **Watch in background**: after the phone restarts and you unlock it, reconnect the machines it was watching, only if watching was on ([RFC 0007](rfcs/0007-watch-after-reboot.md)) |
| Microphone | Speak a message in the side-button panel |
| Camera | Scan the pairing QR code (added by the ZXing scanner library) |
| Install packages, update without asking again | Install updates from GitHub releases; Android asks once |
| Network state | Download automatic updates only on Wi-Fi and other unmetered networks |

## Children

The app is a developer tool and is not directed at children.
