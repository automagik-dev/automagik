// Whose account the app may use (#869). A CLI signed in on this computer is one sign-in per OS
// user, shared with the person's terminal: Automagik uses it for chats, images and the welcome
// only after the person said so, once per vendor and per account. This module is that record.
//
// Per vendor (`acp-claude`, `acp-codex`) the file keeps:
//   consent  'given'    the person confirmed this account, or signed in to it from the app;
//            'carried'  the vendor was already signed in when an install made by an earlier
//                       version first ran this one: it keeps working, and a notice says so once;
//   account  HMAC-SHA256 digests of what names the account (its kind, email, organisation id,
//            key source: account.js `facets`), one per facet, keyed by `key`, a random value
//            made for this install. Never an email, an organisation, a token or a key;
//   carry    true while a vendor an earlier version already offered has not been read signed
//            in yet. The mark stays through every other answer: a check that says "signed out"
//            may be a failed read (a CLI that cannot load its config exits as signed out, a
//            locked keychain, another environment), and a Bot that worked before the upgrade
//            must not go silent for it. The first signed-in read makes it `carried`;
//   noticed  the one-time notice of a carried vendor was shown.
//
// What a read means (`note`):
//   signed out or not known            no state: the sign-in check alone decides, as before,
//                                      and the record (a `carry` mark too) stays as it is;
//   signed in, no record               `needed`, unless the vendor is still marked `carry`;
//   signed in, account not readable    the record stands. An unreadable account never turns a
//                                      consented vendor into `needed`; a facet the record does
//                                      not have yet is taken from the first read that has it;
//   signed in, another account         `needed`, until the person confirms that account: a
//                                      facet both the record and the read have differs. A facet
//                                      only one of them has says nothing (a CLI release that
//                                      starts or stops printing a field is not another account).
//                                      The record stays: the first account coming back needs
//                                      nothing.
//
// The file is written the first time there is something to keep, and always before this
// version installs a connector (`settle`), so a connector found installed with no file can only
// come from an earlier version. An unreadable file is read as that same first run. A version
// that does not know the file ignores it.
//
// Several DSH processes may share one Automagik home (install.js), so the file is never written
// from memory alone: before each read (`note`) and each write (`save`) it is read again, and
// only the vendors this process changed since its last write are its own; every other vendor
// takes what is on disk. A file another process created meanwhile gives its key, and a digest
// made under the key this process had goes (the next read of the account records it again).
