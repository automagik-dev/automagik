// Automagik ACP for DeepSeek Harness: agents other than DSH's own, over the Agent Client
// Protocol, as DSH models (RFC 0003). A Session on one keeps DSH's history and sidebar; the
// agent's tool calls show as DSH tool cards and ask through DSH's approval dialog.
//
// Host only: no browser half, so nothing here can stop the web UI from loading. An agent is
// offered only when its CLI is on this computer and its setting is on; with none, no route is
// registered at all. The set follows the settings and the CLIs live: turning an agent on or
// off, a CLI installed after DSH started (found by the service's refresh), and an adapter
// install that lands all reach the model picker without a restart (`llm/adapters-updated`).
//
// The `acpAgents` service tells a settings page (the welcome's Connect AI and its Settings
// section) what each agent has: its CLI, its connector (the ACP adapter), its sign-in, and
// whether its model is in the picker. Provisioning keeps its own CLI store; switches remain
// this plugin's live settings, written through DSH's settings service.
