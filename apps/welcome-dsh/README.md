# Omni AI for DSH

`@automagik/welcome-dsh` is the first thing a DeepSeek Harness (DSH) shows with Omni
installed: the Omni octopus says hello, then helps you connect an AI. It adds no provider
code. Every sign-in it offers is one DSH 0.2.1-rc.4 already ships, and every route it
writes goes through DSH's own settings and credential store.

## What it does

Two steps on DSH's `settings.onboarding` slot, shown once each on a fresh start (a new
chat with nothing in it), ahead of DSH's own steps:

| Step | Order | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| `omni-welcome` | −300 | The octopus, a typewriter speech bubble and a glitch, on a starfield. |
| `omni-connect-ai` | −200 | Connect AI: one switch per AI, Continue and Skip. |

The Omni channels plugin (`@automagik/omni-channels-dsh`) adds `omni-connect` (−250) between them when it
is installed. DSH's `welcome-notice` (−100) and `deepseek-official` (0) follow.

Each step draws its own modal and makes `#root` inert while it shows. When you finish or
skip a step, the plugin records it in its own settings entry, `omni-ai`, in three live
fields (`welcomeDone`, `connectAiDone`, `connectOmniSkipped`), so the step does not come
back after a restart. A step whose flag is already set completes without showing.

Connect AI is a list of switches, and several can be on. What this computer already has
comes first, under **Found on this computer**: a key in DSH's store
or in the environment, a sign-in DSH already holds, Claude Code or Codex signed in, a
CLIProxyAPI route, Ollama answering on `127.0.0.1:11434`. **Add another** shows four more, then the rest on demand. Continue
needs one AI really on; Skip finishes the step either way.

Flipping a switch on turns on what is set up, or opens its setup in the row: a key field,
the provider's own sign-in in DSH, or, for a provider that takes both (Grok), a choice of the
sign-in or a key. Claude and ChatGPT sign in only through their CLIs (Claude Code, Codex; see
below): their setup offers the CLI's **Sign in**, and for Claude an Anthropic API key. Off
stops using an AI and keeps its key, sign-in or account:

| Kind | On | Off |
|---|---|---|
| Key | writes the pi-ai route that names the key | removes the route; the key stays |
| Sign-in | the route is written once the sign-in succeeds; with no sign-in, a key the row also takes | removes the route; the sign-in and the key stay |
| Claude, ChatGPT | signed in to the CLI: turns on acp-dsh's `claude` or `codex` switch; else (Claude) the Anthropic key's route | turns that switch off, for every Bot on that agent, and removes the key's route; the CLI's sign-in and the key stay |
| CLIProxyAPI | the gateway form writes its route | removes the route; the key stays |
| Ollama | lists its models into a local OpenAI-compatible route | removes the route |
| dsh-subscriptions | shows the vendor's models again | hides them in that plugin's picker settings; the account stays |

DeepSeek is DSH's own route: its row turns on with a key or a DeepSeek account, and its key
is removed in Settings → Models. Every other provider DSH knows stays one link away, in
Settings → Models.

Continue gives the companion and the Omni Bot their model. Both are made without one, so
joining the team sends nothing anywhere; once Connect AI finishes with an AI on, each gets
the team's default model and its held greeting goes out, without a further click. With no
model that can run (Skip, or only a provider that still needs its key), they keep waiting
and their chats offer the ways to set one up.

### The team step and the preload

The team step (`omni-team`) asks who joins the companion's team: Omni and Genie, each a card
with what it starts with. Omni's card starts asleep; its power button installs what a plain
DSH lacks (below), then looks for an Omni to connect. Genie has no DSH plugin yet, and
says so; it can still be added to the team.

The Automagik desktop app passes the product it was opened for (`omni desktop` →
`--preload=omni`, `genie desktop` → `--preload=genie`) to DSH as `AUTOMAGIK_PRELOAD`, which
`state` reports as `preload` (`src/host/preload.js`; anything but `omni`, `genie` or
`unfold` is none). That card comes first and starts chosen: Omni's powers on by itself, through the
same box and steps as a press, and Remove still sends it back to sleep; Genie's starts on
the team. The other card stays to add, then or later. Without a preload Omni comes first
and nothing is chosen.

Unfold's card is shown only in Unfold's own Automagik instance. Anywhere else the team step has
no Unfold card and `unfold-plugin-install` is refused, so the welcome installs no `unfold-*`
plugin. Unfold's own Automagik instance starts DSH with `AUTOMAGIK_HOST=unfold` or
`AUTOMAGIK_PRELOAD=unfold` (either one names it: `src/host/host.js`, the same rule as the Bot
team's and the Unfold Bot's). There Unfold's card comes first and is on the team from the start,
because the Unfold Bot is the instance's Main Bot, so the companion step is done (Unfold leads)
and no other Bot is made. `state` reports it as `host`, and Omni and Genie come with the
instance: Omni's card offers no new Omni of its own, and Genie's names the command line the
instance brought instead of the line that installs one.

### The power shortcut in the Bot team's sidebar

Where the Bot team runs, the welcome puts a power button in its sidebar, between the update
cloud and Search (and in the collapsed rail), through the Bot team's `sidebarTools`
registry: `@automagik/bots-dsh/client` is in `dsh.client.external` and in the build's
`external`, and is looked up only when the plugin applies, so a DSH without the Bot team
gets no button and no error. Its card has a row per product, in the team step's order
(Unfold only in its own instance, read-only), each led by the Bot team's own mark for that
product (its `BotMark`) and offering the one thing to do next: power it on or off, install
it (with a line on what that does, then its step and place, "Installing Genie · 2 of 3 ·
Bot team", from the host's install job), try again with the reason, add the Omni Bot back,
open Plugins, or choose where Omni lives (the Bot itself sits in the sidebar, so a row does
not open it). Powering off is the
team step's own (`powerOff`): it stops a run and puts the box to sleep, and undoes nothing
on the host (a linked Omni stays linked, no Bot is removed); Genie, once on the team, stays,
as on its box. Powering on runs the team step's own steps in a shared store
(`src/client/power-store.js`), so it keeps going when the card or the step closes. That store
lives in the page, so the button reads the host's `omni-plugins` and `genie-plugin` when it
mounts and each time the card opens: an install the host is running (its `install.phase` is
`installing`) that this window does not follow, after a reload or from another window, is
picked up where it is, without asking for a second install, and polled every `POLL_MS`
(900 ms) as the team step polls it, to On or to the reason with Try again. Choosing where Omni
lives, or "Open team setup", opens the team step on purpose: there Continue only closes it and
saves nothing, so the Main Bot keeps its name. Both show only when the Bot team passes the
shell's onboarding opener (`actions.openHarnessOnboarding`).

The team step follows the DSH language. Its copy is the `welcome.team` namespace
(`src/client/i18n.js`): the keys are the English text, registered in English and in Brazilian
Portuguese (`pt-BR`), and the rows the host sends are read through it too. A language pack that
adds `pt-BR` to DSH turns the step Portuguese; it registers no `welcome.team` dictionary of its
own, since DSH takes one per namespace and language. The other steps are English only.

### What the power button installs

The Bot team (`@automagik/bots-dsh`) is this repository's, at this plugin's version: from
the source this plugin came from, pointed at `apps/bots-dsh` (the same commit, or a linked
checkout), else that release's tarball. A release tarball is installed only after every
one about to be installed matches the `lane.json` on the same release, signed with a key
the plugin carries (`src/host/lane-keys.json`, a copy of `plugin-lane/keys.json`): the lane
for this version, each tarball's size, sha256 and sha512. One that does not match, or a
release without a signed lane, stops the install before anything is installed; the checked
tarballs are kept, 0600, under `<AUTOMAGIK_HOME>/welcome/tarballs`, where the profile
installs them from. A DSH that has the team under its former name,
`@automagik/omni-dsh`, has the team: it is switched on, not installed over. Omni's channels
and canvases (`@automagik/omni-channels-dsh`, `@automagik/omni-canvas-dsh`) are Omni's, at
Omni's version: they install as a git source from Omni's repository at the release
`package.json` pins under `automagik.omni`, the same one the desktop app carries
(`apps/desktop/omni.json`; `follow-omni.yml` moves both).

### One way to each AI

| AI | Through | Not offered |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | Claude Code's own sign-in (acp-dsh's `acp-claude`), or an Anthropic API key on pi-ai's `anthropic` route (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) | DSH's Claude Pro/Max sign-in (`llm-pi-ai/anthropic`) |
| ChatGPT | Codex's own sign-in (acp-dsh's `acp-codex`) | DSH's ChatGPT sign-in (`openai-codex`) as a chat route |
| Kimi | DSH's sign-in (`kimi-coding`) | dsh-subscriptions' `kimi` |
| Copilot | DSH's sign-in (`github-copilot`) | dsh-subscriptions' `copilot` |
| Grok | DSH's sign-in (`xai`), or an `XAI_API_KEY` | dsh-subscriptions' `grok` |
| DeepSeek | DSH's key or account | pi-ai's `deepseek` route |
| Ollama | a local pi-ai route | dsh-subscriptions' `ollama` |

A pi-ai route still on DSH's own sign-in for Claude or ChatGPT (`openai-codex`, or `anthropic`
naming no key while DSH holds its Claude sign-in) is a duplicate of the CLI: the row says
*Also connected through DSH sign-in*, and once the CLI can answer, turning the row on (or
**Use only this**) removes that route, but only after the Bot team (bots-dsh's `omniTeam`,
`moveSubscriptionBots`) has moved the Bots on it to the CLI's route. While any Bot (its model,
or the model a pending switch goes back to) or the team's background jobs still run on it, or
the team cannot be read, the route stays and stays listed. Only the route: the sign-in record
stays, and so does any route that names a key. `signin-start` (and the other `signin-*`
endpoints) refuse `anthropic` and `openai-codex`: nothing here starts DSH's own Claude or
ChatGPT plan sign-in. Images and the companion's drawing on a ChatGPT plan go through Codex's
own sign-in (acp-dsh's `generateImage`); an `openai-codex` record an earlier version stored is
read as a last resort only when acp-dsh answers normally and declares a shared auth scope.
An OpenAI API key draws as before. dsh-subscriptions no
longer ships `claude` or `codex` (0.7.21-omni.1), so nothing stands for them.

The route earlier versions added for DSH's Claude sign-in did not retry a 429 (`retryPolicy`
without `RATE_LIMIT`). A route on an API key keeps DSH's default retries, also one such a
sign-in made before the key: saving the key drops the sign-in's policy (a policy set by hand
stays).

dsh-subscriptions keeps the vendors nothing else reaches (Cursor, Kiro, GLM, Qwen,
Perplexity, JetBrains, Cody, Replit and the rest). When an AI is turned on, the other ways
it is connected stop showing: their models are hidden, and no account or stored sign-in is
deleted. A row says when its AI is also
connected another way.

### Claude Code and Codex

With [`@automagik/acp-dsh`](../acp-dsh) in the DSH, Connect AI's Claude and ChatGPT rows are
these CLIs, and DSH's Settings (and the Bot team's) have a **Claude Code and Codex** page with
a row for each agent. Connect AI has no section of its own for them. Without acp-dsh, Claude
takes only its API key, ChatGPT is not offered a sign-in, and the Settings page says the ACP
agents plugin is not running. Each Settings row says (and a Connect AI row shows the same lines
while its CLI is missing, installing or failed, or signed in but not answering yet):

- for Hermes, Antigravity and omp (acp-dsh's native-ACP agents, off until switched on): the
  same row without a connector line, with what switching it on means while it is off, and with
  the terminal command that signs in instead of a Bot's chat (`hermes acp --setup`,
  `agy acp --login`, `omp login`); Automagik never installs these CLIs;
- whether the agent's CLI (`claude`, `codex`) is on this computer, as acp-dsh's own store has
  it: installing or updating it by itself, failed with its error and **Retry**, or found with
  its version; with its install link and **Check again** when it is missing;
- whether the CLI is signed in, as the CLI itself says (`claude auth status`, `codex login
  status`; only yes or no is read). Signed out, the row has **Sign in**, and the command to run
  in a terminal as the other way (`claude auth login`, `codex login`); not checked yet, it says
  so, with **Check again**;
- the connector acp-dsh installs in the background: installing, failed with its last error and
  **Retry**, or ready with its version;
- once ready and signed in, *Ready: pick Claude Code in the model picker*. The model appears
  without a restart; a DSH that has not loaded acp-dsh's routes says to restart instead.

**Sign in** (in Connect AI, **Sign in to Claude Code** or **Sign in to Codex**) opens the sign-in row in a Bot's chat (the selected Bot, or else the Main Bot), through
the Bot team's bridge (`Symbol.for('automagik.cli-login')`, [`@automagik/bots-dsh`](../bots-dsh)).
The row in the chat runs the CLI's own sign-in: a link to open on any device, then Codex's code
to type there or Claude's code to paste back in that row. This page only opens the chat: it starts
no sign-in, picks no model and never sees a link, a code or a credential. In Connect AI the step
steps aside while the chat is in front (a small **Back to setup** brings it back) and is not
completed by it; Settings closes its panel. Without the Bot team or a Bot the row says to run the
command in a terminal instead. While a sign-in waits, the busy file (`src/host/busy.js`, `AUTOMAGIK_BUSY_FILE`) counts it, so an
automatic plugin update does not restart DSH in the middle of it.

The switch is acp-dsh's own `claude` or `codex` setting, written through DSH's settings service,
and Connect AI's Claude and ChatGPT switches are that same setting: off there is off for every
Bot on that agent. An agent that can answer (CLI found, switched on, connector ready, no restart
pending, signed in) is an AI on: its row is on, it counts for Continue and for `aiConnected`.
A signed-out or still-installing CLI does not. Their copy is in the `welcome.team` namespace, in
English and pt-BR.

### Subscription sign-ins and vendor terms

A sign-in with a consumer plan is **personal use under the vendor's terms**: check that
provider's terms before you use a personal plan for work.

## Install into a raw DSH

The plugin needs DSH `>=0.2.1-rc.2 <0.3.0`. Add the Automagik marketplace index to DSH's
plugin market ([marketplace/README.md](../../marketplace/README.md) has the URL and the
steps) and install `@automagik/welcome-dsh` from it. DSH asks before it installs, then
applies the bundle patch (`cordis.patch.yml`), which adds one row, `id: omni-ai`, and
changes nothing else.

Restart DSH and start a new chat to see the octopus.

## The CLIProxyAPI route

[CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI) serves an OpenAI-compatible
API for the providers you sign into on it. The form asks for its address (for example
`http://localhost:8317/v1`; an address without a path gets `/v1`) and its API key. On
Connect, the host:

1. Checks the address is `http://` or `https://`, with no user name, query or fragment.
2. Lists the gateway's models with `GET {baseURL}/models` and `Authorization: Bearer <key>`,
   without following redirects. An empty list refuses the save.
3. Stores the key with `ctx.credentials.set('OMNI_AI_CLIPROXY_API_KEY', key)`.
4. Writes the route into pi-ai's settings entry with
   `ctx.settings.update('llm-pi-ai', patch, revision)`, the revision read from
   `ctx.settings.describe()`:

   ```yaml
   providers:
     cliproxy:
       displayName: CLIProxyAPI
       api: openai-completions
       baseURL: http://localhost:8317/v1
       apiKeyEnv: OMNI_AI_CLIPROXY_API_KEY
       models:
         - { id: <model id>, name: <model id> }
   ```

The key never enters a settings file, a reply or a log: the route names it by the
env-shaped credential reference, which DSH resolves for each request. Saving again
replaces this route's model list and keeps every other route. Use `https://` for a
gateway that is not on your own machine, since the key travels with each request.

The shape was read from DSH 0.2.1-rc.2:

- `dsh-llm-pi-ai`: `Config = z.object({ providers: z.dict(profile).default({}).volatile() })`,
  where a profile has `apiKeyEnv` (a credential reference), `displayName`, `api`, `baseURL`
  and `models: [{ id, name, … }]`. Its README: a route pi-ai does not ship needs `api`,
  `baseURL` and a non-empty `models` list. The base bundle mounts it as entry `llm-pi-ai`.
- `dsh-settings`: `update(ns, patch, expectedRevision)` deep-merges plain objects and
  replaces arrays, so other routes stay and this route's `models` is replaced.
- `dsh-credentials`: a reference matches `/^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$/`.

## Host endpoint

`POST /api/omni-ai` with `{ endpoint, payload }`, answered `{ ok: true, value }` or
`{ ok: false, error: { code, message } }`:

| Endpoint | Payload | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `state` | none | The flags; `deepseek` (a `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` or a DeepSeek account sign-in is stored); `piAiRoutes`; `aiConnected`; `preload` (`omni`, `genie`, `unfold` or null); `host` (`unfold`, only when set); `machine` (`{ os, remoteHint? }`: the OS family DSH runs on, `macos`, `windows`, `linux` or `other`, and `remoteHint: true` when DSH was launched over SSH; never the hostname, user or home). |
| `done` | `{ stepId, connected? }` | Sets the flag for `omni-welcome`, `omni-connect-ai` or `omni-connect`. Connect AI's Continue sends `connected: true`: the companion and the Omni Bot, made without a model, then get the team's default model (DSH's default model when it is served and has its key, else the first model that can run), and their held greetings go out. Skip sets nothing. |
| `cliproxy` | `{ baseURL, apiKey }` | The route above; answers `{ route, baseURL, models }`. |
| `ais` | none | Every row: `{ id, name, via, kind, ready, on, found, signIn?, keyUrl?, needs?, duplicates? }`, and dsh-subscriptions' accounts and hidden vendors. Names and states only. |
| `ai-switch` | `{ id, on }` | Turns a row that is set up on or off (table above). |
| `ai-dedupe` | `{ id }` | Stops the other ways that row's AI is connected. |
| `ai-subscription` | `{ provider, on }` | Shows or hides a dsh-subscriptions vendor's models. |
| `provider-key`, `signin-*` | see `src/host/providers.js` | A key, or a sign-in run through DSH's authorization service. |
| `omni-plugins` | none | The Omni plugins (`@automagik/bots-dsh`, `@automagik/omni-channels-dsh`, `-canvas-dsh`): each one's version and whether it is installed, `ready` once they run here, and the install in progress. |
| `omni-plugins-install` | none | Installs the missing ones in order through DSH's plugin manager (`installBundle`: the Bot team from this plugin's own source pointed at its sibling, else this release's tarball; Omni's from Omni's repository at the pinned release), switching on any that are off. Pressing Omni's power button in the team step calls it. |
| `acp` | `{ refresh? }` | Claude Code and Codex, from acp-dsh's `acpAgents` service: `{ available, agents: [{ id, key, name, on, cli: { found, installUrl?, state?, version?, updating?, error?, diagnostic?, logPath? }, connector: { state, version?, error? }, signedIn?, listed, restartNeeded }] }`. `refresh` looks for the CLIs again and asks each whether it is signed in. `{ available: false }` without acp-dsh. |
| `acp-switch` | `{ id, on }` | Writes acp-dsh's `claude` or `codex` setting in the entry its service names (`settingsEntry`, else `acp-dsh`) at the revision `describe()` gave. |
| `acp-retry` | `{ id }` | Starts a failed connector install again. |
| `bot-type` | `{ type: 'omni' }` | What the Omni Bot starts with, as groups: model and thinking (DSH's default), plugins with versions, tool groups with their switches, skills, folder and permissions. |

The host declares `inject: ['settings', 'credentials', 'connection']`; `connection` serves
the route. It reads DSH's `llm`, `authorization`, `pluginManager`, `agentDefaultModel`, `tools`, `skills`
and `permissionPresets` services when they are there, and acp-dsh's `acpAgents`.

## Develop

```sh
bun install          # esbuild, for the client bundle
bun run harness      # the pinned DSH release the tests and the linter run against
bun run test         # on Node, as DSH runs
bun run lint
bun run build        # rewrites client.js; commit it
node scripts/build-client.mjs --check
```

`client.js` is generated from `src/client` and committed, so git and `link:` installs need
no build step.
