// Omni: a team of long-lived Bots on top of ordinary dsh root Sessions.
// Every Bot is one root Session; the roster, rooms, and the bot-to-bot exchange log live
// in one JSON file in Omni's own home so they survive restarts without new Session event
// types. That home is $AUTOMAGIK_BOTS_HOME, else $AUTOMAGIK_HOME/bots (~/.automagik/bots),
// never under DSH_HOME: installed into someone's own DSH, the team keeps its files apart from
// DSH's and from other plugins'.
