// A Claude or ChatGPT subscription signs in once, through its own CLI (Claude Code, Codex),
// which Automagik installs. Bots that still run on a subscription through DSH (pi-ai's
// `openai-codex`, the ChatGPT sign-in; pi-ai's `anthropic` on a Claude Pro or Max sign-in) move
// once per team to that CLI's route over ACP: `acp-codex/<same id>` and `acp-claude/<same id,
// else the same family>`, else the agent's `default`. A Bot on an API key never moves:
// `openai`, every other route, and `anthropic` whenever a key may be what it runs on.
//
// `anthropic` counts as the Pro or Max sign-in only when all of these hold (anthropicSubscription):
// DSH's settings show its route with no `apiKeyEnv`, DSH's credential store holds pi-ai's
// `llm-pi-ai/anthropic` record as a sign-in grant (its kind only: the value is never read), and
// no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set where pi-ai's own discovery would find it. Anything else, or
// anything this cannot read, is a key route or an unknown one, and is left alone and unmarked.
//
// The move needs three things, and a pass that lacks one moves no one and marks nothing (#868):
// the CLI's route registered (acp-dsh serves it while the agent is on); the agent's catalog
// really read (until acp-dsh's probe answers, a route lists only the agent's `default` stand-in,
// and moving then would drop every Bot's model); and the CLI signed in, as acp-dsh's `inspect`
// says (`destination`). A sign-in that is `false` or unknown is not ready: the Bots stay on the
// route that answers them, and the Bot's settings say why (`subscriptionWaitingView`). A team
// with no Bot on the source route is marked done without asking the CLI anything. No credential
// is copied or read between programs: only the route names on the Bots change.
//
// A waiting pass looks again on a route or settings change, when acp-dsh says the CLI signed in
// (`acp-dsh/login-ready`), at the next start, and on a timer: the catalog every minute (it
// spawns nothing); a sign-in or CLI that could not be read after 1, 5 and 30 minutes, then on
// events only, which do not start those three again until a pass reads a definite answer; a
// CLI that says it is signed out every 10 minutes, so a sign-in done in a terminal is found
// without a restart.
//
// Codex has a way back (`restore: true`). Each moved Bot keeps a record (`subscriptionMoved`:
// the model and level it had and the target; the `previousModel` it had too, when that was not
// its model), and the team keeps when the route moved (`subscriptionMovedAt`). A Bot the person
// re-pointed since is theirs: its record is dropped, also when the pick lands while a pass is
// asking the CLI (the record is read again right before a Bot goes back, and before its
// Session selects). The others go back to exactly what they had, and the route's flag is
// cleared so the gated move runs again later, when:
// - Codex is gone: turned off, its service or row absent, or its CLI install failed. A CLI that
//   is missing or still installing is not gone (a PATH change, an update), and gone must be
//   read at the first pass after a start, or again a minute after it was first read: a burst
//   of events (a settings write, then acp-dsh publishing its routes) is one reading, not two.
//   This read is acp-dsh's `status()`, which spawns nothing, so a settled team never runs the
//   CLI for it.
// - Codex says it is signed out and the record is not `confirmed`. A record is confirmed only
//   by an answer on its target in the Bot's own chat since the move (model-state.js's
//   `lastAnswer`, read by the pass), or by a ready pass late enough that the sign-in read is
//   newer than the move (acp-dsh keeps a "signed in" answer for five minutes). Records written
//   before this gate (v3.109.1) have no `confirmed`, so a team that release stranded on a
//   signed-out Codex is repaired at its first pass.
// Nothing is restored unless `openai-codex` is still registered and DSH still holds its ChatGPT
// grant: without them the Bots stay on Codex, whose chat asks for the sign-in.
//
// This is a deliberate exception to "a plan runs Bots only through its CLI" (models.js D-a,
// D-c): a restored Bot runs on `openai-codex`, a route the model menu treats as covered. It
// keeps that model through edits that leave the model alone (models.js `keep`), cannot be
// picked back onto it, and moves to Codex again once Codex is signed in. Claude has no such
// exception: acp-adoption.js follows the rule, and neither rollback puts a Bot back on the
// `anthropic` sign-in route. A Claude plan Bot only gets the gate.
//
// Each source route is done once (`state.subscriptionCliMoved[<route>]`), so a model the
// person picks later is theirs. `previousModel` follows the same mapping: a confirmed Bot
// stays confirmed on its target, and a pending switch keeps the model it would go back to,
// never a subscription route that no longer answers. A Bot whose model stays but whose
// `previousModel` moved gets a small record of its own (`previousOnly`), so the way back
// covers it too. The Session and its history stay; the next sync selects the target, carrying
// the Bot's level where the agent offers it.
// Auxiliary jobs (prefs.backgroundModel) never run on an agent and are not touched here.
