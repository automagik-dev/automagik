// Runs a browser_exec body away from the host process. The model writes the body, and a
// page can talk the model into writing anything. Two walls stand around it.
//
// The inner wall is the boundary: the interpreter (src/script-child/sandbox.js). The body
// runs in QuickJS compiled to WebAssembly, inside the child process. It shares no object
// with that process's Node, and what crosses is two functions that take text. It has no
// file, process, signal or network API, because nothing gives it one.
//
// The outer wall is the process, for the day the interpreter has a bug. It is a seat
// belt and not a second boundary, and Node says so of its permission model: it "does not
// protect against malicious code", which "can bypass the permission model". So this is a
// list of what Node refuses a script that got out of the interpreter, not of what such a
// script cannot do. Each line has a test on both runtimes the Bot team ships on, Node 24
// and Electron as Node (test/browser-script-wall.test.js):
//
//   refused   files through node:fs, node:module and import(): read, write, list, change
//             the database module that reads and writes files past that (node:sqlite):
//             switched off
//             child processes, worker threads, native addons, WASI, its own inspector
//             the files Node writes on request (a report, a heap snapshot)
//             a change of working folder; that folder is an empty one made for the run
//   withheld  the host's environment: the child gets an empty one
//             the host itself: the one channel is JSON lines on the child's stdin and
//             stdout, and a line the host does not accept ends the run
//             time: at the deadline the host kills the child, it does not ask; a child
//             whose host is gone or stopped ends its script and leaves a second later
//
// What no flag of Node 24 refuses, and so what a script that got out of the interpreter
// could still do:
//
//   - use the network, local sockets included (Node 26 refuses it with these same flags);
//   - signal, or change the priority of, any process of the same user, this host among
//     them. A host that was stopped that way kills nothing at the deadline, and the
//     child's own deadline is the script's to remove once it is out;
//   - read facts about the machine: user name, home folder, host name, network
//     interfaces, and whether a path exists (the last one not from Node 24.22);
//   - on Node 24.9 only, have Node write a trace log or a heap snapshot into the working
//     folder, which is why that folder is the run's own;
//   - change V8's flags, which Node names as outside the model, and from there whatever
//     the bypass Node warns of allows: at worst, what the user's account allows.
//
// Also not bounded or not cleaned, for any script:
//
//   - memory: the two flags below bound the interpreter's WebAssembly memory and the old
//     space of the child's heap. The rest of the child's memory has no flag bound;
//   - the run's folder stays behind when the host exits before it sees the child exit;
//   - the path of the child's entry file is in the interpreter's memory. A script has no
//     way to read it short of a bug in the interpreter.
