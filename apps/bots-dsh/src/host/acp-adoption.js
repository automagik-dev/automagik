// Claude on ACP (RFC 0003, delivery 4). The Claude Code plugin left Automagik and its Bots
// moved once to pi-ai's `anthropic` route (store.js, `claudeCodeMoved`). With dshTools on,
// those Bots move on to `acp-claude`, once per team (`claudeAcpMoved`), when the route can
// actually take them: the ACP plugin's per-session bridge is on and this build's
// delivery-4/6 probes pass, the adapter is installed, and the route lists the model. A Bot
// the person has changed since (or whose model the route does not list) is left alone.
//
// A moved Bot keeps the model and thinking level it had in `acpMoved`. With `dshTools` off, or
// the route gone, it moves back to exactly that. A Bot the person changed since keeps their
// pick: the record is dropped, never applied over it. The off flip is heard live through
// acp-dsh's `acp-dsh/dsh-tools-changed`: DSH's `loader/volatile-update` reaches only the plugin
// whose config changed, so the team cannot watch acp-dsh's setting there. That live path needs
// acp-dsh loaded; when the route is gone and the plugin absent (or the announcement never
// arrived), the start pass reads the route as gone here and reverses from the record then.
//
// `acpAgents.bridge()` runs a live probe on this machine: a fresh per-session credential, the
// bridge over stdio, MCP `initialize` and `tools/list`. A success is cached per installed
// adapter version; a failure is retried after ten minutes or the next start, so one slow start
// never blocks the move forever. An older ACP plugin has no such method and is not migrated.
//
// A Claude Pro or Max plan signs in only through Claude Code now (subscription-move.js): while
// pi-ai's `anthropic` route runs on that sign-in, the rollback never puts a Bot back on it. The
// record is dropped and the Bot stays on `acp-claude`, unavailable while that route is gone
// (turning Claude Code off turns it off for every Bot). A Bot subscription-move.js moved is its
// own record's, never rebuilt here from `claudeCodeModel`.
