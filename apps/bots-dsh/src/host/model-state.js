// What a Bot's model really did, as opposed to what was picked (plan v3, 2.2 and A-3).
//
// Each signal proves one thing and no more: `bot.model` is the choice; a `request/header` in the
// Bot's chat says a call on a route started, not that it answered; only an `assistant/message`
// whose `source` names that route says it answered. Per Bot this module keeps, in memory:
// `requestStarted`, `lastAnswer` and `lastFailure {code, text}`; the state answer reads them with
// `selected` (`bot.model`) and `previousModel`, and `answered` is derived, never written.
//
// `bot.previousModel` is persisted: the last model of the Bot that answered. Its first answer on
// `bot.model` records it, and updateBot keeps it on a change (or records the model it leaves when
// that one answered in this process); a model that never answered is never recorded, so nothing
// goes back to it. While the two differ, the switch is unconfirmed. A switch whose first turn
// fails because the new model cannot run this conversation (DSH's
// MODEL_SWITCH_COMPACTION_FAILED, MODEL_ACCESS_REQUIRED from an agent whose CLI is signed out,
// or a pi-ai route whose provider is not configured: switchFailure) puts the Bot back on
// `previousModel`, Session selection included.
// Nothing runs again on its own: the person's message stays in the chat, and the failed turn's
// error row says why. A fresh part's failed first call goes back the same way (parts.js,
// revertSwitch). The fallback model (fallback.js) never touches `bot.model`.
//
// Only the Bot's own chat counts: a group seat or a task runs the same model, but its turns say
// nothing about the switch made in the chat.
