// A model that fails does not end the conversation: the next turn runs on the fallback
// model (the profile's default, DeepSeek out of the box, or config.fallbackModel) and the
// turn after it is back on the Bot's own model. It covers every Session of the team (a
// Bot's chat, a group seat, a task), after everything that answers a failed request before
// it: DSH's own retries of the same model, and parts.js, which moves a full or stuck chat
// to a fresh part. A full context, a stop, and a fallback that fails too end the turn as
// before. config.fallback: false turns it off.
//
// DSH fixes a step's route before the request and keeps it across that step's retries, and
// agent/request may no longer move it (dsh 0.2.2): the choice is recorded on the Agent with
// agent.model.select() and the continuing turn is woken with agent.followup(). This plugin
// used to rewrite agent/request, which dsh 0.2.2 rejects before the request is admitted.
//
// The followup waits for the Agent to be idle. Sent from agent/request-error, the failed turn
// still runs: DSH puts the notice in the next turn's inbox and latches no wake for it (only
// maintenance or an abort latch one), so it would sit there as a queued message, the fallback
// would never answer, and the person's next message would carry it along. Sent once the failed
// turn ended, it opens the fallback turn. A turn that started meanwhile (the person wrote
// again) already ran on the fallback, so the notice is not sent then.
