// The transcript folder rule (RFC 0015, "Finding a terminal's transcript"; t2x5's review of RFC
// 0014). A path from a label, a hook payload or the workers ledger is used only if it is inside the
// agent's own transcript folder under the machine's home and ends in .jsonl. Labels are free-form,
// so this is what stops one pointing a chat at ~/.ssh. Ours, not Orca's. The cases both copies of
// the rule must pass are herdr/test/fixtures/transcript-folder-rule.json.
//
// Accepted limits (review of #267), for the engine (RFC 0015 delivery 3) to keep in mind:
// - A hard link inside the folder to a file elsewhere passes: realpath cannot see it. Writing one
//   needs the account that owns the folder, which can already read the target.
// - The rule checks a path; the engine opens it later. It runs the rule again at every read, and
//   should compare the opened file's fstat (dev, inode) with the checked one before trusting it.
// - Case is compared as text, so on macOS's case-insensitive disk a path spelled with other case
//   than the folder (`.Claude/projects`) is refused, never wrongly accepted.
// - Remote paths are text only: a name with a leading `-` passes. The engine hands the path to hc
//   as an API argument, never on a command line, and takes `home` from hc, never from a label.
