// The chat engine: one per process, behind the one API both clients call (RFC 0015 delivery 3).
// Ours. Pocket Link's chat route (delivery 4) and the Automagik window (RFC 0014 delivery 9) use
// it; its methods mirror the route's `chat.*`.
//
// - One projection per watched terminal (projection.js), shared by every client watching it; kept
//   10 minutes after the last client leaves, then dropped (nothing is on disk).
// - send, sendHeld, cancelHeld, answer and interrupt act only for a client that watches that
//   terminal, and only on what that client's person did; they are never a tool, an automation or
//   another plugin's (RFC 0015, "Who can call the engine"). The engine never answers on its own.
// - herdr-core is reached with no caller and with HC_TERMINAL_ID removed from hc's environment
//   (chatEnv), so a message is typed as the person wrote it, not as a note from a terminal.
//
// Events to a client's listener: the projection's (rows, screen, status, source, gone, offline),
// plus { type: 'approval', row } (open, or closed with open: false), { type: 'question', row },
// { type: 'held' | 'sent' | 'cancelled', id, ... } from input.js, and { type: 'sending', id } then
// { type: 'matched', id, row } once the transcript shows the message.
