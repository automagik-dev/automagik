// A text file on another machine (automagik#206: a linked machine's .herdr/bots.json), read and
// written through herdr-core with the rule a local edit follows: the write lands only while the
// file still holds the text the edit started from (null: there was no file), else nothing is
// written and the caller is told the snapshot is stale.
//
//   read     hc file read --on M <path>: the text; not_found is "no file" (null), any other
//            answer (the machine away, unknown, too old) throws, so a failure never reads as
//            "no file yet" and a create never replaces a file that is there.
//   replace  hc file edit --on M --old <the whole text read> --new <the whole new text>: the
//            core makes the edit only when the old text is in the file exactly once, so a file
//            changed since the read is refused there, not here (a file holding the old text
//            once and more besides would be the old JSON with text around it, not a bots file).
//   create   a shell there (exec on M): the folder made, then the file opened with noclobber
//            (O_EXCL), so a file that appeared since the read is never replaced; a write that
//            fails after that open removes the file it made.
//   after    an edit or create whose answer was lost may have landed there. herdr-core has no
//            timeout kind: a link that drops mid-call answers `unavailable`, as does the machine
//            away, so that, a timeout, no readable answer or Herdr's exec rejecting all count
//            as lost (only an unknown machine, a needed update or a bad call can't have written): the file is read again, and one that holds the new
//            text is a success; else the state there is unknown, and the caller is told to check
//            the file before retrying (a retried create would add the bot twice).
//   remove   a shell there: the file removed only while it still holds the text read.
//
// Pure: `io` is { hc(args), exec(command, args, machine) }, each resolving { code, stdout,
// stderr } (exec may reject when the machine can't be reached). The sidebar passes Herdr's hc
// and exec, the CLI its own. Apache-2.0.
