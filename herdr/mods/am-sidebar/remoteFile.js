// A text file on another machine (automagik#206: a linked machine's .herdr/bots.json), read and
// written through herdr-core with the rule a local edit follows: the write lands only while the
// file still holds the text the edit started from (null: there was no file), else nothing is
// written and the caller is told the snapshot is stale.
//
//   read     hc file read --on M <path>: the text; not_found is "no file" (null), any other
//            answer (the machine away, unknown, too old) throws, so a failure never reads as
//            "no file yet" and a create never replaces a file that is there.
//   replace  hc file edit --on M --old <the whole text read> --new <the whole new text>: the
//            core makes the edit only when the old text is in the file exactly once, so a file
//            changed since the read is refused there, not here (a file holding the old text
//            once and more besides would be the old JSON with text around it, not a bots file).
//   create   a shell there (exec on M): the folder made, then the file opened with noclobber
//            (O_EXCL), so a file that appeared since the read is never replaced.
//   remove   a shell there: the file removed only while it still holds the text read.
//
// Pure: `io` is { hc(args), exec(command, args, machine) }, each resolving { code, stdout,
// stderr } (exec may reject when the machine can't be reached). The sidebar passes Herdr's hc
// and exec, the CLI its own. Apache-2.0.
