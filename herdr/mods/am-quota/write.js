// Pure, like `translate.js`, so `node --test` can read every line of it. The rules live here and
// are asserted by `test/am-quota-write.test.mjs`:
//   1. the secret is only ever read from a file, never interpolated into a command line;
//   2. the final file is 0600 before it becomes visible and arrives by atomic rename;
//   3. a failed backup aborts the write instead of overwriting unbacked-up;
//   4. a Keychain item is copied out before it is replaced, and can be put back (or the added item
//      deleted) when a later step fails;
//   5. a refusal that happens *before* the item is touched exits 75, so the caller does not roll
//      back something that never changed.
//
// `$1`/`$2` are always positional: nothing here is spliced by string concatenation, so a home
// directory with spaces or `$` cannot change what runs.

 * Writes the Keychain item the CLI actually reads (`security find-generic-password -w -s

 * `security -i` a command line on stdin with the payload hex-encoded via `-X`, because `-w`
 * prompts twice and truncates at 128 bytes, and because a quoted `-w` value would put the token in
 * `security`'s argv. Nothing secret is ever an argument here — only the service name, and the
 * login account, which is what the CLI looks up.
 *
 * Two measured facts keep the 4000-character guard *and* the read-back necessary. `security -i`
 * answers with the status of the last command it ran, so a failed inner add can still exit 0; and
 * an over-long command line is not refused up front — it runs a truncated add (2,012 bytes stored
 * in the measurement) and only then reports an error. The guard refuses what cannot fit; the
 * read-back catches a truncated store.
 *
 * Exit 75 means the payload was refused before the add ran — a multi-line file, or one over the
 * command-line budget — so the caller must not try to put an item back that never changed.
 *
 * The read-back compares HEX on both sides: `security find-generic-password -w` prints its value as
 * hex whenever the bytes hold a non-ASCII byte (not only 0x0a), and as text otherwise — "Café" comes
 * back as 436166c3a9. Comparing text alone would reject every such item even though the bytes were
 * stored correctly.
