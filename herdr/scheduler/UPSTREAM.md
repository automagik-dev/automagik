# Upstream: herdr-automations

The scheduler that fires the automations the pack's panel edits is vendored here from
[DnzzL/herdr-automations](https://github.com/DnzzL/herdr-automations) (MIT, © 2026 Thomas Legrand;
its notice is upstream's `LICENSE`, kept here as `LICENSE` and repeated in `LICENSE-upstream` under
the pack's naming convention). The folder is upstream's tarball, byte for byte, apart from the
excluded paths below and the fork's patch listed under Local changes. `go.mod` keeps upstream's
module path, `github.com/DnzzL/herdr-automations`.

This is not a herdr mod: there is no `mods/` or `main.js` here. The panel stays
`herdr/mods/am-automations`; this folder is the Go binary the panel and the automations run on.

- **Tag:** `v0.12.1`

- **Date:** 2026-11-04 (the commit is dated 2026-11-04T21:01:12Z)

## Excluded upstream paths

```
app/
herdr-automations
docs/*.gif
docs/*.png
.github/
```

- `app/` — upstream's own herdr mod (`app/mods/automations`, its preview and RECIPE). In this
  repository it would show up as a second `herdr-mod` entry; the panel is `herdr/mods/am-automations`.
- `herdr-automations` — the binary upstream commits at its root. Our binary is built by
  `.github/workflows/scheduler-release.yml` and attached to its own release, never committed.
- `docs/*.gif`, `docs/*.png` — the demo recordings and screenshots; they are not source.
- `.github/` — upstream's CI and release workflows. This repository's CI owns our builds.

Every other path is upstream's, byte for byte, except the fork's patch under Local changes. This
folder also adds two files that are not upstream's, which the check script below knows: `UPSTREAM.md`
(this note) and `LICENSE-upstream` (a copy of the tarball's `LICENSE`, checked against it; `LICENSE`
itself stays where upstream puts it).

## Local changes

The fork's patch, one line per path: the check script allows exactly these to differ (or, for a new
file, to be here) and prints each as patched or added; any other difference fails.

```

Why: the #498 stopgap, two scheduler changes. An agent that stays `blocked` on a
dialog longer than `blocked_grace_minutes` on either agent backend (default 2,
`-1` waits for completion or the timeout) now fails at once. The history error carries the
dialog line from the screen and the failure goes out through notify. On hc the
terminal is killed without removing its record. Herdr has no agent-stop API:
the scheduler re-reads the agent status and `pane process-info` before requesting
SIGTERM for an unchanged foreground group, refusing a missing, shell, or scheduler
group. A cleared dialog resumes the run without a blocked failure. The failure
error and log say "asked the agent to stop (SIGTERM)"; exit is not confirmed and
SIGTERM is not escalated, so a TERM-ignoring dialog can survive. Refused or failed
requests are reported as such. The read/signal window is narrowed, not atomic.
Neither failure path asks to close its layout.
Herdr prompt retries check the run deadline before every submit and wait one
status-poll interval between submissions. Three consecutive blocked-submit errors
without an observed blocked status fail with a clear error; the run deadline can
expire sooner. This mismatch does not request a signal.

`close_workspace: on-success` is valid with `workspace: existing`: it asks to
close only the tab the run opened, and closes nothing when the run has no tab id,
when the space's tabs cannot be read, when its tab is no longer listed, or when
that tab is the space's last one at the time of the check. In one scheduler process,
closes serialize per workspace (and Herdr session) and re-read under the lock
immediately before acting: it leaves the last tab it can see. A person closing
the other tabs between the read and the close can still leave it last, and the
app then closes the space. The lock is process-local: a manual `run` or a second
daemon does not share it and can race the same way. The scheduler issues no
space close itself in existing mode; on hc, where a terminal is the tab, it ends
the run's terminal only while another one is there at that read. Each refusal logs
why. The loader no longer refuses that combination, and `ls --json` / `put` carry
`blocked_grace_minutes` like the other keys.

The command kind (#938, ADR 0013): an automation may name `command:` (argv, a working folder,
env) instead of a prompt or a workflow. The daemon starts the program itself, as its own user, with
no pane and no model, bounded by `timeout_minutes`. Exit 0 is `done`; any other exit, a signal, the
timeout or a program that would not start is `failed`, with the exit code, the last lines of stderr
and a one-line result in history. `notify: <bot>` sends that line to the terminal labelled
`bot=<id>` (else a terminal by that name) through `hc send`; what became of the report is recorded
after the status and never changes it. `ls --json` names the kinds a build runs (`kinds`), and
carries `command` and `notify` like the other keys; `put` writes them with the same merge rules.

The earlier patch is still why `close_workspace` exists in the API at all: the pack's
panel sets it per automation (issue #498). `ls --json` names it for every entry, and
`put` accepts it with the same merge rules as the other keys: a value writes it, a
request without the key keeps the hand-written value, an empty value removes the key.
An invalid value is refused by the loader. Keep the patch to this list.

## Refreshing

1. Put the new tarball in a scratch folder (`.cache/` is gitignored and outside the comparison):

   ```sh
   mkdir -p .cache/upstream-v0.12.1
   gh api repos/DnzzL/herdr-automations/tarball/v0.12.1 > .cache/upstream-v0.12.1.tar.gz
   tar -xzf .cache/upstream-v0.12.1.tar.gz -C .cache/upstream-v0.12.1 --strip-components=1
   ```

2. Replace the copy, leaving the excluded paths out. This overwrites the local changes above: re-apply
   them after (or restore your copies), and update the list when the patch changes:

   ```sh
   tar -C .cache/upstream-v0.12.1 -cf - \
     --exclude='./app' --exclude='./herdr-automations' \
     --exclude='./docs/*.gif' --exclude='./docs/*.png' --exclude='./.github' . \
     | tar -C herdr/scheduler -xf -
   ```

3. Prove it. The script downloads that tag's tarball into a temp folder, compares every path the
   exclusion list leaves in, checks `LICENSE-upstream` against the tarball's `LICENSE`, and prints
   the local changes it allowed as patched or added:

   ```sh
   node herdr/scripts/scheduler-upstream.mjs --tag v0.12.1 --dir herdr/scheduler
   ```

   It prints each differing, missing or extra path and exits 1 on any difference; exit 0 means the
   copy is byte-identical to upstream minus the exclusions, with only the Local changes above
   differing.

4. Update the tag, commit and date above, the Local changes list and the entry in `herdr/NOTICE`.
   No lane change is
   needed: `scripts/lane.ts` lists `herdr/scheduler/` in `NEVER_SHIPPED`, so a scheduler refresh
   cuts no release of its own (the binary ships from its own release lane).
