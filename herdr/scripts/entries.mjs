// herdr.dev's crawler skips a whole repository when a herdr-mod entry folder holds `layouts/`,
// and a skip deletes the listing it had (RFC 0011). A herdr-mod entry folder is any folder of the
// repository that holds `mods/<name>/main.js` (the repo root included), as am-mods' findPackages
// reads a package. The layout lives in its own top-level folder instead (herdr-layout/), which
// herdr.dev lists as a layout entry only in its documented shape: layouts/<name>.json beside
// RECIPE.md and preview.png. A .json at that folder's own root is ignored, neither listed nor a
// reason to skip (60 listed layout entries hold one); the crawler probe's e2 went unlisted because
// it had no layouts/<name>.json. The layout entry keeps no mods/ of its own: the pack's mods are
// herdr/'s, and its RECIPE adds that entry first.
//
//   node scripts/entries.mjs --check    exit 1, naming each problem: an entry folder holds layouts/,
//                                       herdr/ is no entry, herdr-layout/ is not a layout entry, or
//                                       herdr-layout/ holds mods/
//
// It reads the files git tracks, from the repository's top, wherever it runs.
