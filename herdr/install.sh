# Automagik Herdr installer (A17): turns a plain Herdr into Automagik Herdr on macOS or Linux.

#   ... | bash -s -- --yes            answer yes to every question (for agents)
#   ... | bash -s -- --version 3.58.0 a given release that carries the pack, instead of the newest

# It checks the OS, Node and Herdr (herdrdev's, dev.herdr.app: offering its own installer from
# releases.herdr.dev, no sudo, asking first),
# reads the signed pointer to the newest pack (the herdr-lane release's pack.json and its ed25519
# signature, checked against the keys embedded below: a desktop or plugin release carries no
# pack, so nothing searches the releases), downloads its pack tarball (automagik-herdr-pack-<v>.tgz: every pack mod
# and layouts/automagik.json), checks it against the sha256 the signed pointer names before
# anything is written (a --version release against its own .sha256), and installs every
# pack mod through the pack's own update.mjs: each folder staged, then swapped in, the replaced
# ones kept together in <app home>/automagik-herdr/.prev. Its ownership record (the marker)
# lists every folder it put in mods/; only those are ever replaced. Any other folder is left
# alone, or with --adopt moved to automagik-herdr/backup/ first. Pocket Link is never touched.
# It merges the pack's free keys, points the mod manager at the catalog, adds the `automagik`
# layout (replacing only v0.2's unchanged copy; in a kept one, or one of the person's own showing
# the sidebar, Herdr's workspace-status block becomes am-status, and it says so), runs
# `herdr-app check` on each mod, and links
# the `automagik-herdr` command into ~/.local/bin. It installs the pinned usagemeter release (the
# token meter the sidebar runs every 10 minutes) to ~/.local/bin/usagemeter, hash-checked and never
# over a newer one, and the same release on every connected linked machine (`hc machine ls`, through
# the pack's `automagik-herdr meter install --linked`: each machine downloads and checks it
# itself); a failure there is only a warning. Safe to run again: a rerun of the installed
# release downloads it all the same, checks every installed pack file against it, reinstalls a
# missing or damaged folder the record lists (the damaged copy kept in backup/), puts back a
# missing automagik layout and runs `herdr-app check` again. It says "up to date" only when every
# file matches, and says whether the mods were checked too (not without herdr-app). It never
# touches a project's .herdr/bots.json or Herdr's settings. Apache-2.0.
#
# The whole script is one function, called on its last line: a download cut short by the
# network defines part of it and runs nothing.
#
# For tests: AUTOMAGIK_HERDR_RELEASE_URL, a file:// folder (files at <url>/download/<tag>/<file>,
# the pointer at <url>/download/herdr-lane/pack.json) or a page of this repository on github.com;
# with a file:// one also AUTOMAGIK_HERDR_TTY (default /dev/tty), AUTOMAGIK_HERDR_APPS (default
# /Applications; ~/Applications is read too) and AUTOMAGIK_HERDR_PACK_KEYS (the trusted keys, as TRUSTED_KEYS: a test's own;
# never honoured for a GitHub URL). HERDR_APP_HOME as Herdr reads it. A file:// release folder also serves usagemeter's
# releases from <url>/usagemeter/download/v<version>/, so a test never reaches the network.

--yes answers yes to every question (installing Node on macOS, Herdr from releases.herdr.dev,
switching Herdr to the automagik layout). --version installs that Automagik release; it must carry the
pack (automagik-herdr-pack-<v>.tgz): not every release does.
--adopt replaces a pack-named mod this installer did not install, after moving it to
<app home>/automagik-herdr/backup/; without it such a folder is reported and left alone.
--no-usagemeter leaves ~/.local/bin/usagemeter (the token meter) alone, here and on every linked
machine: install skips it, and --uninstall keeps it even where this installer put it.
--usagemeter-local-only installs and removes it on this computer only, never on a linked machine
(hc machine ls). Both are remembered for 'automagik-herdr update' and the sidebar's sync.
